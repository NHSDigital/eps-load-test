# Artillery load testing

This repository contains some infrastructure to run load testing against specific Prescription Status Update (PSU) and Custom PSU (CPSU) builds. These are executed as github actions from this repository, and are configured with some basic parameters like max load, and ramp-up parameters.

Reports are generated as standalone webpage files, and are made available as artifacts on the github action.
